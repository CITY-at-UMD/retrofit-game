The purpose of the game is to demonstrate rapid energy simulation tools to evaluate long-term building retrofit projects. Players can test different strategies to achieve different goals, learn to balance integrative design and pursuing best-payback measures first, and discover measures that are ineffective and others that are undervalued for this building.
